      " ,   Sri Lanka ,  [a]   historically known as  Ceylon  and officially the  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , is an  island country  in  South Asia . It lies in the  Indian Ocean , southwest of the  Bay of Bengal , separated from the  Indian peninsula  by the  Gulf of Mannar  and the  Palk Strait . It shares a  maritime border  with the  Maldives  in the southwest and  India  in the northwest.\n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka has a population of approximately 22 million and is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities. The  Sinhalese  people form the majority of the population, followed by the  Sri Lankan Tamils , who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups have played an influential role in the island's history. Other long-established groups include the  Moors ,  Indian Tamils ,  Burghers ,  Malays ,  Chinese , and  Vedda .  [13]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements dating back 125,000 years.  [14]   The earliest known  Buddhist  writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the  Pāli canon , date to the  fourth Buddhist council , which took place in 29 BCE.  [15]    [16]   Also called the  Pearl of the Indian Ocean , or the  Granary of the East , Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of the ancient  Silk Road  trade route to today's so-called  maritime Silk Road .  [17]    [18]    [19]   Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both East Asians and Europeans as long ago as the  Anuradhapura period . During a period of  great political crisis  in the  Kingdom of Kotte , the  Portuguese  arrived in Sri Lanka and sought to control its maritime trade, with a part of Sri Lanka subsequently becoming a  Portuguese possession . After the  Sinhalese-Portuguese war , the  Dutch Empire  and the  Kingdom of Kandy  took control of those areas. The  Dutch possessions  were then taken by the  British , who later extended their control over the whole island,  colonising  it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the early 20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a  dominion . It was succeeded by the  republic  of Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year  civil war , which began in 1983 and ended in 2009, when the  Sri Lanka Armed Forces  defeated the  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .  [20]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka is a  developing country , ranking 73rd on the  Human Development Index . It is the highest-ranked South Asian nation in terms of development and has the second-highest  per capita income  in South Asia. However,  the ongoing economic crisis  has resulted in the collapse of its currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of essentials. It has also led to an eruption of  street protests , with citizens successfully demanding that the  president  and the  government  step down.  [21]   The country has had a long history of engagement with modern international groups; it is a founding member of the  SAARC , the  G77  and the  Non-Aligned Movement , as well as a member of the  United Nations  and the  Commonwealth of Nations .\n",
      " ,  In antiquity, Sri Lanka was known to travellers by a variety of names. According to the   Mahāvaṃsa  , the legendary  Prince Vijaya  named the island  Tambapaṇṇĩ  (\" copper-red  hands\" or \"copper-red earth\"), because his followers' hands were reddened by the  red soil  of the area where he landed.  [22]    [23]   In  Hindu mythology , the term   Lankā   (\"Island\") appears but it is unknown whether it refers to the modern-day state. The Tamil term  Eelam  ( Tamil :  ஈழம் ,  romanized:    īḻam  ) was used to designate the whole island in  Sangam literature .  [24]    [25]   The island was known  under Chola rule  as  Mummudi Cholamandalam  (\"realm of the  three crowned  Cholas\").  [26]  \n",
      " ,   Ancient Greek  geographers called it   Taprobanā   ( Ancient Greek :  Ταπροβανᾶ ) or  Taprobanē  (  Ταπροβανῆ  )  [27]   from the word  Tambapanni . The Persians and Arabs referred to it as  Sarandīb  (the origin of the word \" serendipity \") from  Sanskrit   Siṃhaladvīpaḥ .  [28]    [29]    Ceilão , the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese Empire when it arrived in 1505,  [30]   was transliterated into English as  Ceylon .  [31]   As a British  crown colony , the island was known as Ceylon; it achieved independence as the  Dominion of Ceylon  in 1948.\n",
      " ,  The country is now known in Sinhala as    Śrī Laṅkā    ( Sinhala :  ශ්‍රී ලංකා ) and in Tamil as    Ilaṅkai    ( Tamil :  இலங்கை ,  .mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}  IPA:    [iˈlaŋɡaɪ]  ). In 1972, its formal name was changed to \"Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka\". Later, on 7 September 1978, it was changed to the \"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\".  [32]    [33]   As the name Ceylon still appears in the names of a number of organisations, the Sri Lankan government announced in 2011 a plan to rename all those over which it has authority.  [34]  \n",
      " ,  The pre-history of Sri Lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years.  [35]   The era spans the  Palaeolithic ,  Mesolithic , and early  Iron Ages . Among the  Paleolithic  human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka,  Pahiyangala  (37,000 BP), named after the  Chinese  traveller  monk   Faxian ;  [36]    Batadombalena  (28,500 BP);  [37]   and  Belilena  (12,000 BP) are the most important. In these caves, archaeologists have found the remains of  anatomically  modern  humans  which they have named  Balangoda Man , and other evidence  [38]   suggesting that they may have engaged in  agriculture  and kept domestic dogs for driving game.  [39]  \n",
      " ,  The earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably ancestors of the  Vedda people ,  [40]   an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day Sri Lanka.\n",
      " ,  During the protohistoric period (1000–500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India,  [41]   and shared the same megalithic burials,  pottery , iron technology, farming techniques and  megalithic graffiti .  [42]    [43]   This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the  Velir , prior to the migration of  Prakrit  speakers.  [44]    [45]    [42]  \n",
      " ,  One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian  epic   Ramayana , which provides details of a kingdom named   Lanka   that was created by the divine sculptor  Vishvakarma  for  Kubera , the God of Wealth.  [46]   It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his  rakshasa  stepbrother,  Ravana .  [47]  \n",
      " ,  According to the   Mahāvamsa  , a  Pāḷi  chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are said to be the  Yakshas  and  Nagas . Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of  Prince Vijaya , a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to Sri Lanka, after being expelled from  Vanga Kingdom  (present-day  Bengal ).  [48]   He established the  Kingdom of Tambapanni , near modern-day  Mannar . Vijaya (Singha) is the first of the approximately  189 monarchs of Sri Lanka  described in chronicles such as the   Dipavamsa  ,  Mahāvaṃsa ,   Cūḷavaṃsa  , and  Rājāvaliya .  [49]  \n",
      " ,  Once  Prakrit  speakers had attained dominance on the island, the  Mahavamsa  further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil  Pandya Kingdom  to the  Anuradhapura Kingdom  in the early historic period.  [50]  \n",
      " ,  The  Anuradhapura period  (377 BCE – 1017 CE) began with the establishment of the  Anuradhapura Kingdom  in 380 BCE during the reign of  Pandukabhaya . Thereafter, Anuradhapura served as the  capital city  of the country for nearly 1,400 years.  [51]   Ancient Sri Lankans excelled at building certain types of  structures  such as  tanks ,  dagobas  and palaces.  [52]   Society underwent a major transformation during the reign of  Devanampiya Tissa , with the arrival of  Buddhism  from India. In 250 BCE,  [53]    Mahinda , a  bhikkhu  and the son of the  Mauryan  Emperor  Ashoka  arrived in  Mihintale  carrying the message of Buddhism.  [54]   His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the  Sinhalese population .  [55]  \n",
      " ,  Succeeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain many  Buddhist schools  and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in  Southeast Asia . Sri Lankan Bhikkhus studied in India's famous ancient Buddhist University of  Nalanda , which was destroyed by  Bakhtiyar Khilji . It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in Sri Lanka's many monasteries and that the written form of the  Tripiṭaka , including Sinhalese Buddhist literature, were part of the University of Nalanda.  [56]   In 245 BCE,  bhikkhuni   Sanghamitta  arrived with the  Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi  tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical  Bodhi Tree  under which  Gautama Buddha  became enlightened.  [57]   It is considered the oldest human-planted tree (with a continuous historical record) in the world. ( Bodhivamsa )  [58]    [59]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of  Suratissa , who was defeated by two horse traders named  Sena and Guttika  from  South India .  [55]   The next invasion came immediately in 205 BCE by a  Chola  named  Elara , who overthrew  Asela  and ruled the country for 44 years.  Dutugamunu , the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king,  Kavan Tissa , defeated Elara in the  Battle of Vijithapura . During its two and a half millennia of existence, the  Sinhala Kingdom  was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Indian dynasties such as the  Chola ,  Pandya , and  Pallava . [   citation needed   ]  There also were incursions by the kingdoms of  Kalinga  (modern  Odisha ) and from the  Malay Peninsula  as well. [   citation needed   ] \n",
      " ,  The  Fourth Buddhist Council  of  Theravada  Buddhism was held at the  Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya  in Sri Lanka under the patronage of  Valagamba of Anuradhapura  in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many  Buddhist monks  subsequently died of starvation. Because the  Pāli Canon  was at that time  oral literature  maintained in several recensions by  dhammabhāṇaka s ( dharma  reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.  [60]   After the council,  palm-leaf manuscripts  containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as  Burma ,  Thailand ,  Cambodia  and  Laos .\n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka was the first Asian country known to have a female ruler:  Anula of Anuradhapura  (r. 47–42 BCE).  [61]   Sri Lankan monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as  Sigiriya , the so-called \"Fortress in the Sky\", built during the reign of  Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura , who ruled between 477 and 495. The Sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats. Inside this protective enclosure were gardens, ponds, pavilions, palaces and other structures.  [62]    [63]  \n",
      " ,  In 993 CE, the invasion of  Chola emperor   Rajaraja I  forced the then Sinhalese ruler  Mahinda V  to flee to the southern part of Sri Lanka. Taking advantage of this situation,  Rajendra I , son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas  sacked the city of Anuradhapura  causing the fall of  Anuradhapura Kingdom . Subsequently, they moved the capital to  Polonnaruwa .  [64]  \n",
      " ,  Following a 17-year-long campaign,  Vijayabahu I  successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century.  [65]    [66]   Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from  Burma  to Sri Lanka to re-establish Buddhism, which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign.  [67]   During the medieval period, Sri Lanka was divided into three sub-territories, namely,  Ruhunu , Pihiti and  Maya .  [68]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka's  irrigation system  was extensively expanded during the reign of  Parākramabāhu the Great  (1153–1186).  [69]   This period is considered as a time when Sri Lanka was at the height of its power.  [70]    [71]   He built 1,470 reservoirs – the highest number by any ruler in Sri Lanka's history – repaired 165 dams, 3,910 canals, 163 major reservoirs, and 2,376 mini-reservoirs.  [72]   His most famous construction is the  Parakrama Samudra ,  [73]   the largest irrigation project of medieval Sri Lanka. Parākramabāhu's reign is memorable for two major campaigns – in the south of India as part of a Pandyan war of succession, and a punitive strike against the kings of Ramanna ( Burma ) for various perceived insults to Sri Lanka.  [74]  \n",
      " ,  After his demise, Sri Lanka gradually decayed in power. In 1215,  Kalinga Magha , an invader with uncertain origins, identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom, invaded and captured the  Kingdom of Polonnaruwa . He sailed from  Kalinga   [72]   690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army. Unlike previous invaders, he  looted , ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery.  [75]   His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of  Rajarata  as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native  Sinhalese people  to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.  [76]    [77]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka never really recovered from the effects of Kalinga Magha's invasion. King Vijayabâhu III, who led the resistance, brought the kingdom to  Dambadeniya . The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the  Jaffna kingdom .  [76]    [77]   The Jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of any kingdom of the south except on one occasion; in 1450, following the conquest led by king  Parâkramabâhu VI 's adopted son,  Prince Sapumal .  [78]   He ruled the North from 1450 to 1467 CE.  [79]  \n",
      " ,  The next three centuries starting from 1215 were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of capitals in south and central Sri Lanka, including Dambadeniya,  Yapahuwa ,  Gampola ,  Raigama ,  Kotte ,  [80]    Sitawaka , and finally,  Kandy . In 1247, the Malay kingdom of  Tambralinga  which was a vassal of  Sri Vijaya  led by their king  Chandrabhanu   [81]   briefly invaded Sri Lanka from  Insular Southeast Asia . They were then expelled by the South Indian Pandyan dynasty.  [82]   However, this temporary invasion reinforced the steady flow of the presence of various  Austronesian  merchant ethnic groups, from  Sumatrans  (Indonesia) to  Lucoes  (Philippines) into Sri Lanka which occurred since 200 BCE.  [83]   Chinese admiral  Zheng He  and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle, Sri Lanka in 1409 and got into  battle  with the local king  Vira Alakesvara of Gampola . Zheng He captured King Vira Alakesvara and later released him.  [84]    [85]    [86]    [87]   Zheng He erected the  Galle Trilingual Inscription , a stone tablet at  Galle  written in three  languages  ( Chinese ,  Tamil , and  Persian ), to commemorate his visit.  [88]    [89]   The  stele  was discovered by S. H. Thomlin at Galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the  Colombo National Museum .\n",
      " ,  The early modern period of Sri Lanka begins with the arrival of  Portuguese  soldier and explorer  Lourenço de Almeida , the son of  Francisco de Almeida , in 1505.  [90]   In 1517, the Portuguese built a fort at the port city of  Colombo  and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592, after decades of intermittent warfare with the Portuguese,  Vimaladharmasuriya I  moved his kingdom to the inland city of  Kandy , a location he thought more secure from attack.  [91]   In 1619, succumbing to attacks by the  Portuguese , the independent existence of the  Jaffna kingdom  came to an end.  [92]  \n",
      " ,  During the reign of the  Rajasinha II ,  Dutch  explorers arrived on the island. In 1638, the king signed a  treaty  with the  Dutch East India Company  to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas.  [93]   The following  Dutch–Portuguese War  resulted in a Dutch victory, with Colombo falling into Dutch hands by 1656. The Dutch remained in the areas they had captured, thereby violating the treaty they had signed in 1638. The  Burgher people , a distinct ethnic group, emerged as a result of intermingling between the Dutch and native Sri Lankans in this period.  [94]  \n",
      " ,  The Kingdom of Kandy was the last independent monarchy of Sri Lanka.  [95]   In 1595, Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred  Tooth Relic —the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the  Sinhalese —to Kandy and built the  Temple of the Tooth .  [95]   In spite of on-going intermittent warfare with Europeans, the kingdom survived. Later, a crisis of succession emerged in Kandy upon king  Vira Narendrasinha 's death in 1739. He was married to a  Telugu -speaking  Nayakkar  princess from South India ( Madurai ) and was childless by her.  [95]  \n",
      " ,  Eventually, with the support of  bhikku  Weliwita Sarankara and ignoring the right of  \"Unambuwe Bandara\" , the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha's princesses, overlooking Narendrasinha's own son by a Sinhalese  concubine .  [96]   The new king was crowned  Sri Vijaya Rajasinha  later that year. Kings of the Nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on Dutch controlled areas, which proved to be unsuccessful.  [97]  \n",
      " ,  During the  Napoleonic Wars , fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French, the  British Empire  occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they  called  the colony of  British Ceylon ) with little difficulty in 1796.  [98]   Two years later, in 1798,  Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha , third of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka, died of a fever. Following his death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, eighteen-year-old Kannasamy, was crowned.  [99]   The young king, now named  Sri Vikrama Rajasinha , faced a  British  invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated. The First Kandyan War ended in a stalemate.  [99]  \n",
      " ,  By then the entire coastal area was under the  British East India Company  as a result of the  Treaty of Amiens . On 14 February 1815,  Kandy  was occupied by the British in the  second Kandyan War , ending Sri Lanka's independence.  [99]   Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last native monarch of Sri Lanka, was exiled to India.  [100]   The  Kandyan Convention  formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire. Attempts by Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine British power in 1818 during the  Uva Rebellion  were thwarted by  Governor   Robert Brownrigg .  [101]  \n",
      " ,  The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the  Colebrooke-Cameron reforms  of 1833.  [102]   They introduced a  utilitarian  and  liberal  political culture to the country based on the  rule of law  and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government.  [102]   An  executive council  and a  legislative council  were established, later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature. By this time, experiments with  coffee  plantations were largely successful.  [103]  \n",
      " ,  Soon, coffee became the primary commodity export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices as a result of the  depression of 1847  stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of  rajakariya , requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent.  [103]   These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and  another rebellion  broke out in 1848.  [104]   A devastating leaf disease,   Hemileia vastatrix  , struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years.  [105]   The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead.  Tea production in Sri Lanka  thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.\n",
      " ,  By the end of the 19th century, a new educated  social class  transcending race and  caste  arose through British attempts to staff the  Ceylon Civil Service  and the legal, educational, engineering, and medical professions with natives.  [106]   New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the  Ceylon Legislative Council  on a communal basis. Buddhist and Hindu revivalism reacted against  Christian missionary  activities.  [107]    [108]   The first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and  Tamil  political leadership, which has since been lost.  [109]  \n",
      " ,  The  1906 malaria outbreak in Ceylon  actually started in the early 1900s, but the first case was documented in 1906.\n",
      " ,  In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of  Ponnambalam Arunachalam ,  [110]   pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms. But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for \"communal representation\" by creating a \"Colombo seat\" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s.  [111]  \n",
      " ,  The  Donoughmore reforms  of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced  universal adult franchise  (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created  State Council of Ceylon , which succeeded the legislative council.  [112]    [113]   In 1937, Tamil leader  G. G. Ponnambalam  demanded a 50–50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not met by the  Soulbury reforms  of 1944–45.\n",
      " ,  The Soulbury constitution ushered in  dominion status , with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948.  [114]    D. S. Senanayake  became the first  Prime Minister of Ceylon .  [115]   Prominent  Tamil  leaders including Ponnambalam and  Arunachalam Mahadeva  joined his cabinet.  [112]    [116]   The  British Royal Navy  remained stationed at  Trincomalee  until 1956. A countrywide  popular demonstration  against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of prime minister  Dudley Senanayake .  [117]  \n",
      " ,   S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike  was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound influence through his self-proclaimed role of \"defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture\".  [118]   He introduced the controversial  Sinhala Only Act , recognising  Sinhala  as the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community, which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture.  [119]    [120]    [121]  \n",
      " ,  The  Federal Party  (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance ( satyagraha ) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement ( Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact ) with  S. J. V. Chelvanayakam , leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict.  [122]   The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government  colonisation schemes , contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders.  [123]   Bandaranaike was  assassinated  by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959.  [124]  \n",
      " ,   Sirimavo Bandaranaike , the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an  attempted coup d'état  in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic policies, strengthening ties with the  Soviet Union  and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a  Marxist insurrection , which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a  republic  named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s.  [125]   The  policy of standardisation  by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrollment, which was in essence an  affirmative action  to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education,  [126]   resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy.  [127]    [128]   The assassination of  Jaffna   Mayor   Alfred Duraiyappah  in 1975 by the  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  (LTTE) marked a crisis point.  [129]    [130]  \n",
      " ,  The government of  J. R. Jayawardene  swept to power in 1977, defeating the largely unpopular  United Front  government.  [131]   Jayawardene introduced a  new constitution , together with a  free-market economy  and a powerful  executive presidency  modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first  South Asian  country to  liberalise  its economy.  [132]   Beginning in  1983 , ethnic tensions were manifested in an  on-and-off insurgency  against the government by the LTTE. An  LTTE attack on 13 soldiers  resulted in the start of a civil war, and in response anti-Tamil  race riots  took place, allegedly backed by  Sinhalese hard-line  ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries.  [133]    [134]  \n",
      " ,  Lapses in foreign policy resulted in India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training.  [135]    [136]    [137]   In 1987, the  Indo-Sri Lanka Accord  was signed and the  Indian Peace Keeping Force  (IPKF) was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE.  [138]   The same year, the  JVP  launched its  second insurrection  in Southern Sri Lanka,  [139]   necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in 1990.  [140]   In October 1990, the LTTE  expelled Sri Lankan Moors  (Muslims by religion) from northern Sri Lanka.  [141]   In 2002, the Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire agreement.  [121]  \n",
      " ,  The  2004 Asian tsunami  killed over 30,000 and displaced over 500,000 people in Sri Lanka.  [142]    [143]   From 1985 to 2006, the Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008.  [121]   In 2009, under the  Presidency  of  Mahinda Rajapaksa , the  Sri Lanka Armed Forces  defeated the LTTE, bringing an end to the civil war on 19 May 2009,  [144]    [145]    [146]    [147]   and re-established control of the entire country by the Sri Lankan Government.  [148]   Overall, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the course of the 26 year long conflict.  [149]    [150]  \n",
      " ,   2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings  carried out by the terrorist group  National Thowheeth Jama'ath  on 21 April 2019 resulted in the death of 261 innocent people.  [151]   On 26 April 2019 an anti  terrorist operation  was carried out against the National Thowheeth Jama'ath by the  Sri Lanka Army  with the operation being successful and National Thowheeth Jama'ath's insurgency ending.  [152]    [153]    [154]  \n",
      " ,  Economic troubles in Sri Lanka began in 2019, when a  severe economic crisis  occurred caused by rapidly increasing foreign debt, massive government budget deficits due to tax cuts, falling foreign remittances, a food crisis caused by mandatory organic farming along with a ban on chemical fertilizers, and a multitude of other factors.  [155]   The Sri Lankan Government officially declared the ongoing crisis to be the worst  economic crisis in the country  in 73 years.  [156]   In August 2021, a food emergency was declared.  [157]   In June 2022, Prime Minister  Ranil Wickremesinghe  declared the collapse of the Sri Lankan economy in parliament.  [158]   The crisis resulted in Sri Lanka defaulting on its $51 billion sovereign debt for the first time in its history, along with double-digit inflation, a crippling energy crisis that led to approximately 15 hour power cuts, severe fuel shortages leading to the suspension of fuel to all non-essential vehicles, and more such economic disorder.  [159]    [160]   Due to the crisis, massive  street protests  erupted all over the country, with protesters demanding the resignation of the then-incumbent President  Gotabaya Rajapaksa . The protests culminated with the storming and siege of the  President's House  on July 9, 2022, and resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing to Singapore  [161]   and later emailing his resignation to parliament, formally announcing his resignation and making him the first Sri Lankan president to resign in the middle of his term.  [162]   On the same day the President's House was stormed, protesters besieged and stormed the  private residence of the prime minister  and burnt it down.  [163]  \n",
      " ,  After winning the  2022 Sri Lankan presidential election , on 21 July 2022,  Ranil Wickremesinghe  took oath as the ninth President of Sri Lanka.  [164]   He implemented various economic reforms in efforts to stabilize Sri Lanka's economy.  [165]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka, an island in  South Asia  shaped as a teardrop or a pear/ mango ,  [166]   lies on the  Indian Plate , a major  tectonic plate  that was formerly part of the  Indo-Australian Plate .  [167]   It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the  Bay of Bengal , between latitudes  5°  and  10° N , and longitudes  79°  and  82° E .  [168]   Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the  Indian subcontinent  by the  Gulf of Mannar  and  Palk Strait . According to  Hindu mythology , a land bridge existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a  chain of limestone shoals  remaining above  sea level .  [169]   Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 CE, until  cyclones  deepened the channel.  [170]    [171]   Portions are still as shallow as 1 metre (3 ft), hindering navigation.  [172]   The island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. The highest point is  Pidurutalagala , reaching 2,524 metres (8,281 ft) above sea level.\n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the  Mahaweli River , extending 335 kilometres (208 mi).  [173]   These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 metres (33 ft) or more. The highest is  Bambarakanda Falls , with a height of 263 metres (863 ft).  [174]   Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585 km (985 mi) long.  [175]   Sri Lanka claims an  exclusive economic zone  extending 200  nautical miles , which is approximately 6.7 times Sri Lanka's land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as  fringing   coral reefs  and shallow beds of coastal and  estuarine   seagrasses .  [176]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka has 45  estuaries  and 40  lagoons .  [175]   Sri Lanka's  mangrove  ecosystem spans over 7,000  hectares  and played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the  2004 Indian Ocean tsunami .  [177]   The island is rich in minerals such as  ilmenite ,  feldspar ,  graphite ,  silica ,  kaolin ,  mica  and  thorium .  [178]    [179]   Existence of  petroleum  and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed, and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway.  [180]  \n",
      " ,  The climate is  tropical  and warm because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17 °C (62.6 °F) in the  central highlands , where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33 °C (91.4 °F) in low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from 28 °C (82.4 °F) to nearly 31 °C (87.8 °F). Day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °C (57.2 °F) to 18 °C (64.4 °F).  [181]  \n",
      " ,  The rainfall pattern is influenced by  monsoon  winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The \"wet zone\" and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of Sri Lanka constitute the \"dry zone\", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm (47 and 75 in) of rain annually.  [182]  \n",
      " ,  The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least rain at 800 to 1,200 mm (31 to 47 in) per year. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes  tropical cyclones  bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall.  [183]   An increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events has resulted in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure, utility supply and the urban economy.  [184]  \n",
      " ,   Western Ghats  of India and Sri Lanka were included among the first 18 global  biodiversity hotspots  due to high levels of species endemism. The number of biodiversity hotspots has now increased to 34.  [186]   Sri Lanka has the highest biodiversity per unit area among Asian countries for flowering plants and all vertebrate groups except birds.  [187]   A remarkably high proportion of the species among its flora and fauna, 27% of the 3,210 flowering plants and 22% of the mammals, are  endemic .  [188]   Sri Lanka supports a rich avifauna of that stands at 453 species and this include 240 species of birds that are known to breed in the country.  33 species  are accepted by some ornithologists as endemic while some ornithologists consider only 27 are endemic and the remaining six are considered as proposed endemics.  [189]   Sri Lanka's protected areas are administrated by two government bodies; The  Department of Forest Conservation  and the  Department of Wildlife Conservation . Department of Wildlife Conservation administrates 61 wildlife sanctuaries, 22 national parks, four nature reserves, three strict nature reserves, and one jungle corridor while Department of Forest Conservation oversees 65 conservation forests and one national heritage wilderness area. 26.5% of the country's land area is legally protected. This is a higher percentage of protected areas when compared to the rest of Asia.  [190]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka contains four terrestrial ecoregions:  Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ,  Sri Lanka montane rain forests ,  Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests , and  Deccan thorn scrub forests .  [191]   Flowering  acacias  flourish on the arid  Jaffna Peninsula . Among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species such as  satinwood ,  ebony ,  ironwood ,  mahogany  and  teak . The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes.  [192]  \n",
      " ,   Yala National Park  in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks. The  Wilpattu National Park  in the northwest, the largest national park, preserves the habitats of many water birds such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. The island has four  biosphere reserves :  Bundala ,  Hurulu Forest Reserve , the  Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya , and  Sinharaja .  [193]   Sinharaja is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species, including the elusive  red-faced malkoha , the  green-billed coucal  and the  Sri Lanka blue magpie . The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Of the 211 woody trees and lianas within the reserve, 139 (66%) are endemic. The total vegetation density, including trees, shrubs, herbs, and seedlings, has been estimated at 240,000 individuals per hectare. The Minneriya National Park borders the  Minneriya Tank , which is an important source of water for elephants inhabiting the surrounding forests. Dubbed \"The Gathering\", the congregation of elephants can be seen on the tank-bed in the late dry season (August to October) as the surrounding water sources steadily disappear. The park also encompasses a range of micro-habitats which include classic dry zone tropical monsoonal evergreen forest, thick stands of giant bamboo, hilly pastures (patanas), and grasslands (talawas).  [194]  \n",
      " ,  During the Mahaweli Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totalling 1,900 km 2  (730 sq mi) as national parks. Statistics of Sri Lanka's forest cover show rapid deforestation from 1956 to 2010. In 1956, 44.2 percent of the country's land area had forest cover. Forest cover depleted rapidly in recent decades; 29.6 percent in 1999, 28.7 percent in 2010.  [195]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka is a  democratic   republic  and a  unitary state  which is governed by a  semi-presidential system .  [196]   Sri Lanka is the oldest democracy in Asia.  [197]   Most provisions of the constitution can be amended by a  two-thirds majority  in  parliament . The amendment of  certain basic features  such as the clauses on language, religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state require both a two-thirds majority and approval in a nationwide  referendum .\n",
      " ,  In common with many democracies, the Sri Lankan government has three branches:\n",
      " ,  The current political culture in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the  centre-left  and  progressive   United People's Freedom Alliance  (UPFA), an offspring of  Sri Lanka Freedom Party  (SLFP), and the comparatively  right-wing  and pro- capitalist   United National Party  (UNP). after 2018 two major political parties have split with UNP majority has formed  Samagi Jana Balawegaya  and UPFA majority has formed  Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna . The third wing party  Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna  has gain popularity after 2022.\n",
      " ,    [208]   Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist, socialist, and Tamil nationalist political parties. As of July 2011, the number of registered political parties in the country is 67.  [209]   Of these, the  Lanka Sama Samaja Party  (LSSP), established in 1935, is the oldest.  [210]  \n",
      " ,  The UNP, established by D. S. Senanayake in 1946, was until recently the largest single political party.  [211]   It is the only political group which had representation in all parliaments since independence.  [211]   SLFP was founded by  S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike  in July 1951.  [212]   SLFP registered its first victory in 1956, defeating the ruling UNP in the  1956 Parliamentary election .  [212]   Following the parliamentary election in  July 1960 ,  Sirimavo Bandaranaike  became the prime minister and the world's first elected  female head of government .  [213]  \n",
      " ,   G. G. Ponnambalam , the  Tamil nationalist  counterpart of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike,  [214]   founded the  All Ceylon Tamil Congress  (ACTC) in 1944. Objecting to Ponnambalam's cooperation with D. S. Senanayake, a dissident group led by  S.J.V. Chelvanayakam  broke away in 1949 and formed the  Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi  (ITAK), also known as the Federal Party, becoming the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka for next two decades.  [215]   The Federal Party advocated a more aggressive stance toward the Sinhalese.  [216]   With the constitutional reforms of 1972, the ACTC and ITAK created the Tamil United Front (later  Tamil United Liberation Front ). Following a period of turbulence as Tamil militants rose to power in the late 1970s, these Tamil political parties were succeeded in October 2001 by the  Tamil National Alliance .  [216]    [217]    Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna , a  Marxist–Leninist  political party founded by  Rohana Wijeweera  in 1965, serves as a third force in the current political context.  [218]   It endorses leftist policies which are more radical than the traditionalist leftist politics of the LSSP and the  Communist Party .  [216]   Founded in 1981, the  Sri Lanka Muslim Congress  is the largest Muslim political party in Sri Lanka.  [219]  \n",
      " ,  President  Mahinda Rajapaksa  lost the  2015 presidential elections , ending his ten-year presidency. However, his successor as Sri Lankan President,  Maithripala Sirisena , decided not to seek re-election in 2019.  [220]   The Rajapaksa family regained power in November  2019 presidential elections  when Mahinda's younger brother and former wartime defence chief  Gotabaya Rajapaksa  won the election, and he was later sworn in as the new president of Sri Lanka.  [221]    [222]   Their firm grip of power was consolidated in the  parliamentary elections  in August 2020. The family's political party,  Sri Lanka People's Front  (known by its Sinhala initials SLPP), obtained a landslide victory and a clear majority in the parliament. Five members of the Rajapaksa family won seats in the new parliament. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa became the new prime minister.  [223]  \n",
      " ,  In 2022, a  political crisis  started due to the power struggle between  President   Gotabaya Rajapaksa  and the  Parliament of Sri Lanka . The crisis was fuelled by  anti-government protests and demonstrations by the public  and also due to the worsening  economy of Sri Lanka  since 2019. The anti-government sentiment across various parts of Sri Lanka has triggered unprecedented political instability, creating shockwaves in the political arena.  [224]  \n",

      " ,  Provinces in Sri Lanka have existed since the 19th century, but they had no legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment of the 1978 constitution established provincial councils after several decades of increasing demand for a  decentralisation  of the government.  [228]   Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities,  [228]   but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils.  [229]    [230]   Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the  North-East Province .  [231]    [232]   Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks for the provinces were handled by a district-based civil service which had been in place since colonial times. Now each province is administered by a directly elected provincial council:\n",
      " ,  Each district is administered under a  district secretariat . The districts are further subdivided into 256  divisional secretariats , and these to approximately 14,008  Grama Niladhari  divisions.  [236]   The districts are known in Sinhala as  disa  and in Tamil as  māwaddam . Originally, a  disa  (usually rendered into English as Dissavony) was a  duchy , notably Matale and Uva.\n",
      " ,  There are three other types of local authorities: municipal councils (18), urban councils (13) and pradeshiya sabha, also called pradesha sabhai (256).  [237]   Local authorities were originally based on feudal counties named  korale  and  rata , and were formerly known as \"D.R.O. divisions\" after the divisional revenue officer.  [238]   Later, the D.R.O.s became \"assistant government agents,\" and the divisions were known as \"A.G.A. divisions\". These divisional secretariats are currently administered by a divisional secretary.\n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka is a founding member of the  Non-Aligned Movement  (NAM). While ensuring that it maintains its independence, Sri Lanka has cultivated  relations with India .  [239]   Sri Lanka became a member of the  United Nations  in 1955. Today, it is also a member of the  Commonwealth , the  SAARC , the  World Bank , the  International Monetary Fund , the  Asian Development Bank , and the  Colombo Plan .\n",
      " ,  The United National Party has traditionally favoured links with the West, while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has favoured links with the East.  [239]   Sri Lankan Finance Minister J. R. Jayewardene, together with then Australian Foreign Minister Sir Percy Spencer, proposed the Colombo Plan at the Commonwealth Foreign Minister's Conference held in Colombo in 1950.  [240]   At the  San Francisco Peace Conference  in 1951, while many countries were reluctant, Sri Lanka argued for a free  Japan  and refused to accept payment of reparations for  World War II  damage because it believed it would harm Japan's economy.  [241]   Sri Lanka-China relations started as soon as the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949. The two countries signed an important  Rubber-Rice Pact  in 1952.  [242]   Sri Lanka played a vital role at the  Asian–African Conference  in 1955, which was an important step in the crystallisation of the NAM.  [243]  \n",
      " ,  The Bandaranaike government of 1956 significantly changed the pro-western policies set by the previous UNP government. It recognised Cuba under  Fidel Castro  in 1959. Shortly afterward, Cuba's revolutionary  Che Guevara  paid a visit to Sri Lanka.  [244]   The  Sirima-Shastri Pact  of 1964  [245]   and  Sirima-Gandhi Pact  of 1974  [246]   were signed between Sri Lankan and Indian leaders in an attempt to solve the  long-standing dispute  over the status of  plantation workers of Indian origin . In 1974,  Kachchatheevu , a small island in  Palk Strait , was formally ceded to Sri Lanka.  [247]   By this time, Sri Lanka was strongly involved in the NAM, and the  fifth NAM summit  was held in Colombo in 1976.  [248]   The relationship between Sri Lanka and India became tense under the government of  J. R. Jayawardene .  [140]    [249]   As a result,  India intervened in the Sri Lankan Civil War  and subsequently deployed an  Indian Peace Keeping Force  in 1987.  [250]   In the present, Sri Lanka enjoys extensive relations with China,  [251]   Russia,  [252]   and Pakistan.  [253]  \n",
      " ,  The  Sri Lanka Armed Forces , comprising the  Sri Lanka Army , the  Sri Lanka Navy , and the  Sri Lanka Air Force , come under the purview of the  Ministry of Defence .  [254]   The total strength of the three services is around 346,000 personnel, with nearly 36,000 reserves.  [255]   Sri Lanka has not enforced  military conscription .  [256]   Paramilitary units include the  Special Task Force , the  Civil Security Force , and the  Sri Lanka Coast Guard .  [257]    [258]  \n",
      " ,  Since independence in 1948, the primary focus of the armed forces has been internal security, crushing three major insurgencies, two by  Marxist  militants of the  JVP  and a 26-year-long conflict with the  LTTE . The armed forces have been in a continuous mobilised state for the last 30 years.  [259]    [260]   The Sri Lankan Armed Forces have engaged in  United Nations   peacekeeping  operations since the early 1960s, contributing forces to permanent contingents deployed in several UN peacekeeping missions in  Chad ,  Lebanon , and  Haiti .  [261]  \n",
      " ,  According to the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lanka's  GDP  in terms of  purchasing power parity  is the second highest in the South Asian region in terms of  per capita income . In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a  plantation economy  famous for its production and export of  cinnamon ,  rubber , and  Ceylon tea , which remains a trademark national export.  [262]   The  development of modern ports  under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade.  [263]   From 1948 to 1977, socialism strongly influenced the government's economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised, and a  welfare state  established. In 1977, the  free market  economy was introduced to the country, incorporating privatisation, deregulation, and the promotion of private enterprise.  [132]  \n",
      " ,  While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar, and other commodities remain important, industrialisation has increased the importance of food processing, textiles, telecommunications, and finance. The country's main economic sectors are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production, and other agricultural products. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment, especially in the Middle East, contributes substantially in foreign exchange.  [264]  \n",
      " ,  As of 2020  [update]  , the service sector makes up 59.7% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.2%, and the agriculture sector 8.4%.  [265]   The private sector accounts for 85% of the economy.  [266]   China, India and the United States are Sri Lanka's largest trading partners.  [267]   Economic disparities exist between the provinces with the Western Province contributing 45.1% of the GDP and the Southern Province and the Central Province contributing 10.7% and 10%, respectively.  [268]   With the end of the war, the Northern Province reported a record 22.9% GDP growth in 2010.  [269]  \n",
      " ,  The per capita income of Sri Lanka doubled from 2005 to 2011.  [271]   During the same period, poverty dropped from 15.2% to 7.6%, unemployment rate dropped from 7.2% to 4.9%,  market capitalisation  of the  Colombo Stock Exchange  quadrupled, and the  budget deficit  doubled.  [264]   99% of the households in Sri Lanka are electrified; 93.2% of the population have access to safe drinking water; and 53.1% have access to pipe-borne water.  [265]   Income inequality has also dropped in recent years, indicated by a  Gini coefficient  of 0.36 in 2010.  [272]  \n",
      " ,  The 2011  Global Competitiveness Report , published by the  World Economic Forum , described Sri Lanka's economy as transitioning from the factor-driven stage to the efficiency-driven stage and that it ranked 52nd in global competitiveness.  [273]   Also, out of the 142 countries surveyed, Sri Lanka ranked 45th in health and primary education, 32nd in business sophistication, 42nd in innovation, and 41st in goods market efficiency. In 2016, Sri Lanka ranked 5th in the  World Giving Index , registering high levels of contentment and charitable behaviour in its society.  [274]   In 2010,   The New York Times   placed Sri Lanka at the top of its list of 31 places to visit.  [275]    S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices  classifies Sri Lanka as a  frontier market  as of 2018.  [276]    Sri Lanka ranks  well above other South Asian countries in the  Human Development Index  (HDI) with an index of 0.750.\n",
      " ,  By 2016, the country's debt soared as it was developing its infrastructure to the point of near bankruptcy which required a bailout from the  International Monetary Fund  (IMF).  [277]   The IMF had agreed to provide a US$1.5 billion bailout loan in April 2016 after Sri Lanka provided a set of criteria intended to improve its economy. By the fourth quarter of 2016, the debt was estimated to be $64.9 billion. Additional debt had been incurred in the past by state-owned organisations and this was said to be at least $9.5 billion. Since early 2015, domestic debt increased by 12% and external debt by 25%.  [278]   In November 2016, the IMF reported that the initial disbursement was larger than US$150 million originally planned, a full US$162.6 million (SDR 119.894 million). The agency's evaluation for the first tranche was cautiously optimistic about the future. Under the program, the Sri Lankan government implemented a new Inland Revenue Act and an automatic fuel pricing formula which was noted by the IMF in its fourth review. In 2018 China agreed to bail out Sri Lanka with a loan of $1.25 billion to deal with foreign debt repayment spikes in 2019 to 2021.  [279]    [280]    [281]  \n",
      " ,  In September 2021, Sri Lanka declared a major  economic crisis .  [282]   The Chief of its Central Bank has stepped down amid the crisis.  [283]   The Parliament has declared emergency regulations due to the crisis, seeking to ban \"food hoarding\".  [284]    [285]  \n",
      " ,  Tourism, which provided the economy with an input of foreign currency, has significantly declined as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  [286]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka has an extensive road network for inland transportation. With more than 100,000 km (62,000 mi) of paved roads,  [287]   it has one of the highest road densities in the world (1.5 km or 0.93 mi of paved roads per every 1 km 2  or 0.39 sq mi of land). The road network consists of 35  A-Grade highways  and  four   controlled-access highways .  [288]    [289]   A and B grade roads are national (arterial) highways administered by Road Development Authority.  [290]   C and D grade roads are provincial roads coming under the purview of the Provincial Road Development Authority of the respective province. The other roads are local roads falling under local government authorities.\n",
      " ,  The  railway network , operated by the state-run  National Railway  operator  Sri Lanka Railways , spans 1,447 kilometres (900 mi).  [291]   Sri Lanka also has three  deep-water ports  at  Colombo ,  Galle , and  Trincomalee , in addition to the newest port being built at  Hambantota .\n",
      " ,  In June 2021,  Sri Lanka imposed a nationwide ban on inorganic fertilisers and pesticides. The program was welcomed by its advisor  Vandana Shiva ,  [292]   but ignored critical voices from scientific and farming community who warned about possible collapse of farming,  [293]    [294]    [295]    [296]    [297]   including financial crisis due to devaluation of national currency pivoted around tea industry.  [293]   The situation in the tea industry was described as critical, with farming under the organic program being described as ten times more expensive and producing half of the yield by the farmers.  [298]   In September 2021 the government declared an economic emergency, as the situation was further aggravated by falling national currency exchange rate, inflation rising as a result of high food prices, and pandemic restrictions in tourism which further decreased country's income.  [282]  \n",
      " ,  In November 2021, Sri Lanka abandoned its plan to become the world's first organic farming nation following rising food prices and weeks of protests against the plan.  [299]   As of December 2021, the damage to agricultural production was already done, with prices having risen substantially for vegetables in Sri Lanka, and time needed to recover from the crisis. The ban on fertiliser has been lifted for certain crops, but the price of urea has risen internationally due to the price for oil and gas.  [286]   Jeevika Weerahewa, a senior lecturer at the  University of Peradeniya , predicted that the ban would reduce the paddy harvest in 2022 by an unprecedented 50%.  [300]  \n",

      "Sri Lanka has roughly 22,156,000 people and an annual population growth rate of 0.5%. The  birth rate  is 13.8 births per 1,000 people, and the  death rate  is 6.0 deaths per 1,000 people.  [265]   Population density is highest in western Sri Lanka, especially in and around the capital.  Sinhalese  constitute the largest ethnic group in the country, with 74.8% of the total population.  [301]    Sri Lankan Tamils  are the second major ethnic group in the island, with a percentage of 11.2%.  Moors  comprise 9.2%. There are also small ethnic groups such as the  Burghers  (of mixed European descent) and  Malays  from Southeast Asia. Moreover, there is a small population of  Vedda people  who are believed to be the original indigenous group to inhabit the island.  [302]   ,   Sinhala  and  Tamil  are the two  official languages .  [304]   The constitution defines  English  as the link language. English is widely used for education, scientific and commercial purposes. Members of the  Burgher  community speak variant forms of  Portuguese Creole  and Dutch with varying proficiency, while members of the Malay community speak a form of  Creole   Malay  that is unique to the island.

      " ,  Religion in Sri Lanka (2012 census)  [306]    [307]  \n",
      " ,   Buddhism  is the largest and is considered as an \" Official religion \" of Sri Lanka under Chapter II, Article 9, \"The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana\".  [308]    [309]  \n",
      "Buddhism is practised by 70.2% of the Sri Lankan population with most being predominantly from  Theravada  school of thought.  [310]   Most Buddhists are of the Sinhalese ethnic group with minority Tamils. Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 2nd century BCE by  Mahinda Maurya .  [310]   A sapling of the  Bodhi Tree  under which  the Buddha  attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka during the same time. The  Pāli Canon  ( Thripitakaya ), having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE.  [311]   Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any predominantly Buddhist nation.  [310]   During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Thailand and Burma.  [311]  \n",
      " ,  Although  Hindus in Sri Lanka  form a religious minority, Hinduism has been present in Sri Lanka at least since the 2nd century BCE.  [312]   Hinduism was the dominant religion in Sri Lanka before the arrival of Buddhism in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka by Mahinda, the son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of King  Devanampiya Tissa ;  [313]   the Sinhalese embraced Buddhism and Tamils remain Hindus in Sri Lanka. However, it was activity from across the  Palk Strait  that truly set the scene for  Hinduism 's survival in Sri Lanka.  Shaivism  (devotional worship of Lord Shiva) was the dominant branch practised by the Tamil peoples, thus most of the traditional  Hindu temple architecture  and  philosophy  of Sri Lanka drew heavily from this particular strand of  Hinduism . Thirugnanasambanthar mentioned the names of several Sri Lankan Hindu temples in his works.  [314]  \n",
      " ,   Islam  is the third most prevalent religion in the country, having first been brought to the island by Arab traders over the course of many centuries, starting around the mid or late 7th century CE. Most followers on the island today are  Sunni  who follow the  Shafi'i school   [315]   and are believed to be descendants of Arab traders and the local women whom they married.  [316]  \n",
      " ,   Christianity  reached the country at least as early as the fifth century (and possibly in the first),  [317]   gaining a wider foothold through Western colonists who began to arrive early in the 16th century.  [318]   Around 7.4% of the Sri Lankan population are Christians, of whom 82% are  Roman Catholics  who trace their religious heritage directly to the Portuguese. Tamil Catholics attribute their religious heritage to  St. Francis Xavier  as well as Portuguese missionaries. The remaining Christians are evenly split between the  Anglican Church of Ceylon  and other  Protestant denominations .  [319]  \n",
      " ,  There is also a small population of  Zoroastrian  immigrants from India ( Parsis ) who settled in Ceylon during the period of British rule.  [320]   This community has steadily dwindled in recent years.  [321]  \n",
      " ,  Religion plays a prominent role in the life and culture of Sri Lankans. The  Buddhist  majority observe  Poya  Days each month according to the  Lunar calendar , and  Hindus  and  Muslims  also observe their own holidays. In a 2008  Gallup poll , Sri Lanka was ranked the third most religious country in the world, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion was an important part of their daily life.  [322]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lankans have a  life expectancy  of 75.5 years at birth, which is 10% higher than the world average.  [265]    [264]   The infant mortality rate stands at 8.5 per 1,000 births and the maternal mortality rate at 0.39 per 1,000 births, which is on par with figures from developed countries. The universal \"pro-poor\"  [323]   health care system adopted by the country has contributed much towards these figures.  [324]   Sri Lanka ranks first among southeast Asian countries with respect to deaths by suicide, with 33 deaths per 100,000 persons. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, poverty, destructive pastimes, and inability to cope with stressful situations are the main causes behind the high suicide rates.  [325]  \n",

[327]   Its youth literacy rate stands at 98.8%,  [328]   computer literacy rate at 35%,  [329]   and primary school enrollment rate at over 99%.  [330]   An education system which dictates 9 years of  compulsory schooling  for every child is in place.\n",
      " ,  The  free education  system established in 1945  [331]   is a result of the initiative of  C. W. W. Kannangara  and A. Ratnayake.  [332]    [333]   It is one of the few countries in the world that provide universal free education from primary to tertiary stage.  [334]   Kannangara led the establishment of the  Madhya Vidyalayas  (central schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka's rural children.  [329]   In 1942, a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality education system for the people. However, in the 1980s changes to this system separated the administration of schools between the central government and the provincial government. Thus the elite  national schools  are controlled directly by the  ministry of education  and the provincial schools by the provincial government. Sri Lanka has approximately 10,155 government schools, 120 private schools and 802  pirivenas .  [265]  \n",
      " ,  Sri Lanka has 17 public universities.  [335]    [336]   A lack of responsiveness of the education system to labour market requirements, disparities in access to quality education, lack of an effective linkage between secondary and tertiary education remain major challenges for the education sector.  [337]   A number of private, degree awarding institutions have emerged in recent times to fill in these gaps, yet the participation at tertiary level education remains at 5.1%.  [338]   Sri Lanka was ranked 90th in the  Global Innovation Index  in 2023.  [339]    [340]  \n",
      " ,  The  Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation  (formerly  Radio Ceylon ) is the oldest-running radio station in Asia,  [341]   established in 1923 by  Edward Harper  just three years after broadcasting began in Europe.  [341]   The station broadcasts services in Sinhala, Tamil, English and Hindi. Since the 1980s, many private radio stations have also been introduced. Broadcast television was introduced in 1979 when the  Independent Television Network  was launched. Initially, all television stations were state-controlled, but private television networks began broadcasting in 1992.  [342]  \n",

[265]   In recent years,  freedom of the press  in Sri Lanka has been alleged by media freedom groups to be amongst the  poorest in democratic countries .  [343]   Alleged abuse of a newspaper editor by a senior government minister  [344]   achieved international notoriety because of the unsolved murder of the editor's predecessor,  Lasantha Wickrematunge ,  [345]   who had been a critic of the government and had presaged his own death in a posthumously published article.

      " ,  Officially, the constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees human rights as ratified by the United Nations. However, several groups, such as  Amnesty International ,  Freedom from Torture ,  Human Rights Watch ,  [347]   as well as the  British government   [348]   and the  United States Department of State  have criticised human rights violations in Sri Lanka.  [349]   The  Sri Lankan Government  and the LTTE have both been accused of violating human rights. A  report by an advisory panel to the UN secretary-general  accused both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government of  war crimes  during final stages of the civil war.  [350]    [351]   Corruption remains a problem in Sri Lanka, and there is little protection for those who stand up against corruption.  [352]   The 135-year-old  Article 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code  criminalises  homosexual acts , with a penalty of up to ten years in prison.  [353]  \n",

[354]   The Sri Lankan government confirmed that 6,445 of these died. Allegations of human rights abuses have not ended with the close of the ethnic conflict.  [355]  \n",
      " ,   UN Human Rights Commissioner   Navanethem Pillay  visited Sri Lanka in May 2013. After her visit, she said: \"The war may have ended [in Sri Lanka], but in the meantime, democracy has been undermined and the rule of law eroded.\" Pillay spoke about the military's increasing involvement in civilian life and reports of military  land grabbing . She also said that, while in Sri Lanka, she had been allowed to go wherever she wanted, but that Sri Lankans who came to meet her were harassed and intimidated by security forces.

      " ,  In 2012, the UK charity  Freedom from Torture  reported that it had received 233 referrals of torture survivors from Sri Lanka for clinical treatment or other services provided by the charity. In the same year, the group published  Out of the Silence , which documents evidence of torture in Sri Lanka and demonstrates that the practice has continued long after the end of the civil war in 2009.

      " ,  The  culture of Sri Lanka  is influenced primarily by Buddhism and Hinduism.  [360]   Sri Lanka is the home to two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese (centred in Kandy and Anuradhapura) and the Tamil (centred in Jaffna). Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early mixing rendered the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinguishable.  [361]   Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius in  hydraulic engineering  and  architecture . The British colonial culture has also influenced the locals. The rich cultural traditions shared by all Sri Lankan cultures is the basis of the country's long life expectancy, advanced health standards, and high literacy rate.  [362]  \n",

[363]    Jackfruit  may sometimes replace rice. Traditionally food is served on a  plantain leaf or lotus leaf . Middle Eastern influences and practices are found in traditional Moor dishes, while Dutch and Portuguese influences are found with the island's Burgher community preserving their culture through traditional dishes such as  lamprais  (rice cooked in stock and baked in a banana leaf),  breudher  (Dutch holiday biscuit), and  Bolo fiado  (Portuguese-style layer cake).

Ranmuthu Duwa   ( Island of Treasures ) marked the transition of cinema from  black-and-white  to colour. In recent years, movies have featured subjects such as family melodrama, social transformation and the years of conflict between the military and the LTTE.

[369]   Traditional music instruments such as  Béra ,  Thammátama ,  Daŭla  and  Răbān  were performed at these dramas. The first music album,  Nurthi , recorded in 1903, was released through Radio Ceylon. Songwriters like  Mahagama Sekara  and  Ananda Samarakoon  and musicians such as  W. D. Amaradeva ,  Victor Ratnayake ,  Nanda Malini  and  Clarence Wijewardene  have contributed much towards the progression of Sri Lankan music.  [370]    Baila music  originated among  Kaffirs  or the Afro-Sinhalese community.  [371]  \n",
      " ,  There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the  Kandyan dances , low country dances and  Sabaragamuwa  dances. Of these, the Kandyan style is most prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance  [372]   that consists of five sub-categories:  Ves dance ,  Naiyandi dance ,  Udekki dance ,  Pantheru dance  and  18 Vannam .  [373]   An elaborate headdress is worn by the male dancers, and a drum called  Geta Béraya  is used to assist the dancers to keep on rhythm.  [374]  \n",
      " ,  The history of Sri Lankan painting and sculpture can be traced as far back as to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE.  [375]   The earliest mention about the art of painting on Mahāvaṃsa, is to the drawing of a palace on cloth using  cinnabar  in the 2nd century BCE. The chronicles have a description of various paintings in relic chambers of Buddhist stupas and in monastic residences.\n",
      " ,  Theatre came to the country when a  Parsi theatre  company from  Mumbai  introduced  Nurti , a blend of European and Indian theatrical conventions to the Colombo audience in the 19th century.  [373]   The golden age of Sri Lankan drama and theatre began with the staging of  Maname , a play written by  Ediriweera Sarachchandra  in 1956.  [376]   It was followed by a series of popular dramas like  Sinhabāhu ,  Pabāvatī ,  Mahāsāra ,  Muudu Puththu  and  Subha saha Yasa .\n",
      " ,  Sri Lankan literature spans at least two millennia and is heir to the  Aryan  literary tradition as embodied in the hymns of the  Rigveda .  [377]   The  Pāli Canon , the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, was written down in Sri Lanka during the  Fourth Buddhist council , at the Alulena cave temple,  Kegalle , as early as 29 BCE.  [378]   Chronicles such as the  Mahāvaṃsa , written in the 6th century, provide vivid descriptions of Sri Lankan dynasties. According to the German philosopher  Wilhelm Geiger , the chronicles are based on Sinhala  Atthakatha  (commentary).  [377]   The oldest surviving prose work is the  Dhampiya-Atuva-Getapadaya , compiled in the 9th century CE.  [377]   The greatest literary feats of medieval Sri Lanka include  Sandesha Kāvya  (poetic messages) such as  Girā Sandeshaya  (parrot message),  Hansa Sandeshaya  (swan message) and  Salalihini Sandeshaya  (myna message). Poetry including  Kavsilumina ,  Kavya-Sekharaya  ( Diadem of Poetry ) and proses such as  Saddharma-Ratnāvaliya ,  Amāvatura  ( Flood of Nectar ) and  Pujāvaliya  are also notable works of this period, which is considered to be the golden age of Sri Lankan literature.  [377]   The first modern-day novel,  Meena  by Simon de Silva appeared in 1905  [373]   and was followed by several revolutionary literary works.  Martin Wickramasinghe , the author of   Madol Doova   is considered the iconic figure of Sri Lankan literature.  [379]  \n",
      " ,  While the  national sport  is  volleyball , by far the most popular sport in the country is  Cricket .  [380]    Rugby union  also enjoys extensive popularity,  [381]   as do  association football ,  netball  and  tennis . Aquatic sports such as boating, surfing, swimming, kitesurfing  [382]   and  scuba diving  attract many Sri Lankans and foreign tourists. There are two styles of martial arts native to Sri Lanka:  Cheena di  and  Angampora .  [383]  \n",
      " ,  The  Sri Lanka national cricket team  achieved considerable success beginning in the 1990s, rising from  underdog  status to winning the  1996 Cricket World Cup , defeating  Australia  in the final on 17 March 1996.  [385]   They also won the  2014 ICC World Twenty20  played in Bangladesh, beating India in the final. In addition, Sri Lanka became the runners-up of the  Cricket World Cup  in  2007   [386]   and  2011 ,  [387]   and of the  ICC World Twenty20  in  2009  and  2012 .  [388]   Former Sri Lankan  off-spinner   Muttiah Muralitharan  has been rated as the greatest  test match   bowler  ever by   Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  ,  [389]   and four Sri Lankan cricketers ranked 2nd ( Sangakkara ), 4th ( Jayasuriya ), 5th ( Jayawardene ) and 11th ( Dilshan ) highest ODI run scorers of all time, which is the second best by a team. As of June 2022,  Muttiah Muralitharan has the highest aggregate wickets in Test Cricket with a record 800 wickets, a feat he achieved in a Test Match against India in July 2010 that Sri Lanka had won by 10 Wickets.  [390]    [391]   Sri Lanka has won the  Asia Cup  in 1986,  [392]   1997,  [393]   2004,  [394]   2008,  [395]   2014.  [396]   and 2022.  [397]   Sri Lanka once held the highest team score in all three formats of cricket.  [398]   The country co-hosted the Cricket World Cup in  1996  and  2011  and hosted the  2012 ICC World Twenty20 .\n",
      " ,  Sri Lankans have won two medals at  Olympic Games : one silver, by  Duncan White  at the  1948 London Olympics  for men's  400 metres hurdles ;  [399]   and one silver by  Susanthika Jayasinghe  at the  2000 Sydney Olympics  for women's  200 metres .  [400]   In 1973,  Muhammad Lafir  won the  World Billiards Championship , the highest feat by a Sri Lankan in a  Cue sport .  [401]   Sri Lanka has also won the Carrom World Championship titles twice in 2012,  2016   [402]   and 2018, the men's team becoming champions and the women's team winning second place. The  Sri Lankan National Badminton Championships  was annually held between 1953 and 2011.\n",
      " ,   Sri Lanka national football team  also won the prestigious  1995 South Asian Gold Cup .  [403]    [404]    [405]    [406]    [407]  \n",
